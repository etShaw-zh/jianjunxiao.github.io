This April, I had my first trip to Japan, where I gave a talk at Kansai University on "Automatic Assessment of Social and Cognitive Presence to Promote Meaningful Collaboration between cMOOC Learners and GPT-Driven Agents," which earned me the "Young Scholar Award." I also enjoyed a relaxing time with my companions in Nara, feeding the deer.

This November, I volunteered at the Beijing Marathon, providing post-run stretching services. I'd already received professional training in stretching services before that.

This August, I had the chance to visit Hefei and take part in the iFLYTEK Spark Training Camp, which was held at the company's HQ for a week. During the event, I teamed up with a few classmates and we put together an evaluation report on the iFLYTEK Spark large language model and developed a shopping assistance plugin. Our team came in fourth overall. I also made some great friends and made some big steps forward in my personal development.  

In October, I was lucky enough to represent my research team at the 5th iFLYTEK Intelligent Education Forum â€“ Doctoral Sub-forum, a big conference about how smart tech is changing the way we learn. At the forum, I gave a talk, sharing our research findings and insights.

I've just finished my Master of Science degree in Educational Technology at Beijing Normal University. The graduation ceremony was held at Fu Jen Catholic University, which was a great way to mark the occasion. After the ceremony, we went on a graduation trip to Beibei Farm, which was a perfect end to this chapter of my academic journey.

During the pandemic, our school introduced a closed management policy. Unfortunately, I broke my foot playing badminton. Throughout my recovery, lots of friends and colleagues were really helpful and supportive. I'm really grateful for all their help and support.
